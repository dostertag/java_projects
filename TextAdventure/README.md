Make a simple text based "rpg" battle game (think pokemon, old final fantasy games). Start with just 2 characters with health, strength and defense. Start out with an enemy that just attacks every turn while you can either pick attack/defend.
Once that's done, maybe add a spell that costs mp, a simple heal. You can teach the enemy to use it's heal below a certain health threshhold. You can keep expanding with different type of abilities.
When you have the basics down you can keep expanding and make it a little more complex. Add Magic Attack, Magic Defense and speed to the stats. Maybe some elemental affinity/weakness like pokemon has? Create an array of inventory items, make it possible to swap your character with another during battle.
It'd make a good excersice to use different types of design patterns and reusable code.



ideas for implementing 'first project'  -- not really interested in game dev, but logic/class structure/game loop seems worth it....


<h6>To Do</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Separate text interface from game so it's easily replaced by javaFX</li>
  </ul>
